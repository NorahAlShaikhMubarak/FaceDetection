# FaceDetection
# Task2: part of task 2 is to write a python code to detect faces in images

In this task I have used google colab. Google Colab is a free cloud service and now it supports free GPU. You can; improve your Python programming language coding skills. develop deep learning applications using popular libraries such as Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and OpenCV.

# To run the code: 
1. You have to run each cell 
2. Upload the image + the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml file which a Cascade Classifier
3. Run the following cells until you reach the output

# What is cascade classifier?
Cascading classifiers are trained with several hundred "positive" sample views of a particular object and arbitrary "negative" images of the same size. After the classifier is trained it can be applied to a region of an image and detect the object in question.

# Output
